# AeroSolvedSystem

Welcome to AeroSolvedSystem.

AeroSolvedSystem is an implementation of the AeroSolved&#8482; library using the Modelica&#174; language. AeroSolved was developed to study multispecies aerosol dynamics starting from the aerosol generation through its evolution, transport, and deposition. The implemented aerosol physics is applicable to a wide range of practical applications, including the development of aerosol generators, inhalation devices, validation of aerosol delivery systems for in vivo inhalation studies and in vitro sciences as well as for atmospheric sciences.

The AeroSolved project is led and funded by Philip Morris International R&D (PMI R&D).  

AeroSolvedSystem is a Modelica library. AeroSolvedSystem is not approved or endorsed by the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/association.html).
